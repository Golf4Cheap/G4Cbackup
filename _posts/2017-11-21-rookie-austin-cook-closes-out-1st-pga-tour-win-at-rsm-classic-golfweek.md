Here is a wrap-up of the final round of the RSM Classic at the Beachfront Course at Sea Island Golf Club in St Simons Island, Ga.:

WINNER: Austin Cook earns his first PGA Tour win in simply his 14th start on the circuit.

The PGA Tour novice looked absolutely nothing like one all week, as Cook took the lead through 36 holes and never relented from there. Cook published a second-round 8-under 62 at Seaside to move into a one-shot lead and didn't make his first bogey up until the 50th hole of the competition.

Cook just made two bogeys over the last 36 holes, closing 66-67 to play the weekend in 7 under and finish 4 ahead at 21 under overall.

He closed it out for good by burying a 14-footer for birdie at the 71st hole to move his result in 3. He then put a cherry on the top with another 14-footer for birdie at the last.

The poise needs to not be surprising for the 26-year-old despite his lack of experience, as he made it through a number of Monday qualifiers for PGA Tour occasions a few years earlier.

Cook proceeded to end up 15th on the Web.com Tour cash list in 2017 to earn his PGA Tour card for 2017-18. Prior to this win, Cook had placed leading 25 (with a best of T-20) in 2 of his very first 3 starts this season. His best PGA Tour surface prior to this week was a tie for sixth at the 2015 Barbasol Championship.

Cook made an early bogey Sunday at No. 2 and his lead was down to one at some time, however, he never ever flinched. Birdies at Nos. 7 and 15 ensured he 'd have a cushion down the stretch, and then he liquidated absolutely.

Welcome to Augusta, Rookie. Cook should have an area in the Masters, which he got with this win, then some with his extremely calm existence under pressure in his first time in this circumstance.

JUST MISSED: J.J. Spaun almost holes out for eagle at 18 but settles for birdie to end up 2nd at 17 under. Brian Gay does hole out for eagle to close in solo third at 16 under.

SHOT OF THE DAY: What a magical surface, Mr. Gay.
QUOTABLE: " Yeah, I slept dreadful last night."-- Austin Cook ... well, ball game didn't show it!

SHORT SHOTS: Chris Kirk, the 18-hole leader, ties for 4th at 14 under. ... Zach Johnson ties for eighth at 13 under. ... Matt Kuchar ties for 29th at 8 under. ... Patton Kizzire follows up his win recently with a T-45 showing at 6 under. ... Braden Thornberry, the reigning NCAA private champion and Haskins Award winner, shoots 74 but it's still a good T-61 for the Ole Miss junior. ... Bubba Watson ends up solo 67th at 2 under.

UP NEXT: The Tour will now take a break, with the next event being the Sentry Tournament of Champions from Jan. 4-7. The Hero World Challenge, an unofficial event that marks Tiger Woods' return, will take place Nov. 30-Dec. 3.
