On Jan. 3, 2017, Volvik announced that Bubba Watson had actually signed a multi-year endorsement handle the firm and also would play the four-piece S4 ball going forward. But on Tuesday in Las Vegas, during his interview before the Shriners Hospitals For Kid Open, Watson claimed he no more will use Volvik balls.

" My agreement is finished with Volvik," the two-time Masters champion said. "I do not have a ball offer as we sit here today. So I can play with whatever ball I intend to. My deal was up, and so I'm ball-free. So I don't enjoy the deal. ... I'm simply most likely to go back to what I matured with, so I'm playing Titleist."

Watson will certainly play a Titleist Pro V1x, but he did not work with company reps in Las Vegas prior to switching. Watson made the change to the Pro V1x on his own.
