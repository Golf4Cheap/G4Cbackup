Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee tweeted side-by-side photos of two versions of Tiger Woods's swing on Thursday early morning, sparking several replies from four-time PGA Tour winner Billy Horschel, who questioned whether Chamblee had the proper insight to review Woods.

Horschel replied numerous times to Chamblee and called him "a ghost on the variety."

Chamblee tweeted two photos of Woods swinging, one from 2001 and another from 2013, and he called the 14-time major-champ's swing in the latter picture "Trackman-drunk." Horschel asked Chamblee to elaborate, and after he did, Horschel insinuated that Chamblee didn't understand what Woods and then-coach Sean Foley were dealing with.

" Are you sure that's what Sean and Tiger were trying to accomplish," Horschel wrote. "Doubt you spoke to either of them about exactly what they were dealing with. You are a ghost on the variety."
<div>Chamblee said he did talk to Foley and paid attention to Woods's swing objectives, then ended his tweet by stating, "and I've spent a lifetime on the range, my friend."</div>

Horschel acknowledged Chamblee's credibility as a wise expert, however, stated Chamblee does not pace the variety as much as some of his counterparts who "are getting very first-hand knowledge and seeing face to face instead of on TV."

Horschel added: "You do a fantastic job with stats and looking at all the information. Most likely best in the business. Your associates say the same thing. But I think it would be beneficial if you strolled the range once or twice to speak with people and see things in person instead of in camera. ... You were in the booth a couple of years back at Pebble and strolled the variety and spoke to trainers early in the week. On air, you said it was really helpful for you. You saw shots face to face and actually were able to talk and see what trainers were working on with trainees."
