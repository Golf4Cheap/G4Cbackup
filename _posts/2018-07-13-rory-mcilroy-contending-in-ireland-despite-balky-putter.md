But McIlroy's round could have been even better had he not gone cold on the greens, missing at least seven putts from inside 15 feet including four over his first five holes.</p><p>McIlroy is 110th this season on the PGA Tour in strokes gained: putting, and his issues on the greens carried with him across the Atlantic after the Ulsterman took a week off following a T-12 finish at last month's Travelers Championship. He birdied two of the three par-5s at Ballyliffin, but outside of that could only manage makes on the par-3 seventh and a lengthy birdie on the par-4 12th.</p><p>After one round, it's a similar story to McIlroy's week at TPC River Highlands, where he led the field in strokes gained: tee-to-green and was last among the 74 players who made the cut in strokes gained: putting.</p><p>McIlroy will not play next week's Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open, meaning this will be his final competitive start before turning his attention to earning a second claret jug later this month at Carnoustie.</p></article></p></div></section></section><section data-reactid=52><div data-reactid=56><div data-reactid=64><div data-reactid=65></div><div data-reactid=80></div></div></div></section></div><p data-reactid=98><section data-reactid=99><section data-reactid=100><div data-reactid=110><h1 data-reactid=111>Teen phenom Niemann sets early pace at Greenbrier</h1></div></section><section data-reactid=118><div data-reactid=119><p data-reactid=130><article data-reactid=131><p>The Old White TPC is a rare PGA Tour venue where Joaquin Niemann has some experience, and he put it to good use Thursday during his opening round at The Greenbrier.</p><p>Niemann closed out last year's event in West Virginia with a 64 in the final round as an 18-year-old amateur, and now returning as a professional he did one better Thursday, carding seven birdies en route to a 7-under 63 to take an early one-shot lead.</p><p>The Chilean started on the back nine and wasted little time, making birdies on five of his first eight and six of his first 10 holes. A closing birdie on No. 9 moved him one clear of Kelly Kraft among the morning wave.</p><p>"I made a couple good birdies in the start of the round," Niemann told reporters. "After that, I thought I was going really low. My game was feeling really good and my putter was good. So all my game was good today."</p><p>Niemann won the Latin America Amateur this year, and he remained an amateur to play in the Masters. He turned pro in April, promptly finishing sixth at the Valero Texas Open in his pro debut. That was simply the first of three top-10s to date, as he also finished T-8 at Colonial and T-6 at the Memorial.</p><p>His result at Muirfield Village gained him special temporary membership, meaning Niemann can accept unlimited sponsor invites through the end of the season. He's on the cusp of earning a full PGA Tour card for the 2018-19 season, a rare feat of bypassing Q-School or Web.com Tour Finals most recently achieved by Jordan Spieth (2013) and Jon Rahm (2016).</p><p>Niemann entered this week with 321 FedExCup points as a non-member. To earn a full card for next season, he has to accrue at least the equivalent of whichever player finished No. 125 on the season-long points list after the Wyndham Championship. Last season, that mark was 365 points.</p></article></p></div></section></section><section data-reactid=141><div data-reactid=145><div data-reactid=153><div data-reactid=154></div><div data-reactid=169></div></div></div></section></p><p data-reactid=184><section data-reactid=185><section data-reactid=204><div data-reactid=205><p data-reactid=216><article data-reactid=217><p>The Old White TPC course at The Greenbrier has long been kind to Ted Potter, Jr. He surprisingly won there for his maiden PGA Tour victory in 2012. He tied for sixth in '13 and is 4-for-4 in making the cut at this event.</p><p>Thanks to a little luck in Round 1 on Thursday, he's giving himself a chance to make it 5-for-5.</p><p>Potter, who began his first round on the 10th hole, was in trouble at the par-4 14th, facing this chip shot for par. He bladed it, but instead of his ball racing past the hole, it hit the flagstick and fell in. He walked away with his 4 and remained at even par for the tournament.</p><blockquote data-lang=en>— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) <a href="https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/1014859205319090176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2018</a></blockquote></article></p></div></section></section><section data-reactid=230><div data-reactid=234><div data-reactid=242><div data-reactid=243></div><div data-reactid=258></div></div></div></section></p><div data-reactid=273><section data-reactid=274><section data-reactid=275><div data-reactid=277><p data-reactid=278><span data-reactid=279> Kingston Heath</span><span data-reactid=282> Getty Images </span></p></div><div data-reactid=288><h1 data-reactid=289>Kingston Heath, Victoria GC to host future Australian Opens</h1></div></section><section data-reactid=296><div data-reactid=297><p data-reactid=308><article data-reactid=309><p>MELBOURNE, Australia – Golf Australia said Thursday that Kingston Heath and Victoria Golf Club on Melbourne's sandbelt will host future editions of the Australian Open.</p><p>Kingston Heath Golf Club will host the 2020 Australian Open and Victoria was chosen for 2022.</p><p>This year's Australian Open will be played at The Lakes Golf Club in Sydney from Nov. 15-18.</p><p>The Australian Golf Club, also in Sydney, will host the 2019, 2021 and 2023 editions.</p></article></p></div></section></section><section data-reactid=325><div data-reactid=329><div data-reactid=337><div data-reactid=338></div><div data-reactid=353></div></div></div></section></div><p data-reactid=371><section data-reactid=372><section data-reactid=391><div data-reactid=392><p data-reactid=403><article data-reactid=404><p>While you're out enjoying the Fourth of July, so are a host of your favorite tour pros.</p><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk0myQAgp3s/ data-instgrm-version=8><div><p>A post shared by <a href=https://www.instagram.com/justinthomas34/ target=_blank> Justin Thomas</a> (@justinthomas34) on <time datetime=2018-07-04T19:45:51+00:00>Jul 4, 2018 at 12:45pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><blockquote data-lang=en>— bubba watson (@bubbawatson) <a href="https://twitter.com/bubbawatson/status/1014543699123081217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2018</a></blockquote><blockquote data-lang=en><p>I love this country and am proud to be an American.</p>— Chesson Hadley (@chessonhadley) <a href="https://twitter.com/chessonhadley/status/1014472200311754753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2018</a></blockquote><blockquote data-lang=en>— Nelly Korda (@NellyKorda) <a href="https://twitter.com/NellyKorda/status/1014550446898319362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2018</a></blockquote><blockquote data-lang=en>— Michelle Wie (@themichellewie) <a href="https://twitter.com/themichellewie/status/1014550225019654145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2018</a></blockquote><blockquote data-lang=en>— Paula Creamer (@ThePCreamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePCreamer/status/1014502535716012032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2018</a></blockquote><blockquote data-lang=en><p lang=en dir=ltr>Appreciate and enjoy this <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FourthofJuly?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FourthofJuly</a> with family &amp; friends, just as much as you should appreciate and enjoy your everyday freedoms!
