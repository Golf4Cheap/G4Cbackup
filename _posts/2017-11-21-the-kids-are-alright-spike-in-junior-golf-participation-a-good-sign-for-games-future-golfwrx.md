The folks over at the USGA understand a thing or 2 about growing the video game and making it more available and they should, they've been doing it given that the association's starting in 1894.

The inaugural 3 USGA champions-- the United States Open, U.S. Amateur and U.S. Women's Amateur in 1895-- did not have age limitations, each merely intending to recognize the champ golf enthusiast. In 1948, the USGA held the very first United States Junior Amateur entirely available to gamers under the age of 18 and simply one year later on the association performed the very first United States Girls' Junior Championship.

In addition to assisting fund The First Tee, LPGA-USGA Girls Golf, and the Drive, Chip and Putt Championships, the USGA just recently presented its "For the Good of the Game" grant program to promote a more inviting and available video game at the regional level with countless dollars used to regional neighborhoods to develop programs.

" The biggest misperception is availability," states Beth Major, Director of Community Outreach at the USGA. "Two-thirds of all golf courses in America are open to the general public. Kids and moms and dads still think it is a country club sport and we have to alter that."

Founded in 2013 as a joint effort in between the USGA, the Masters Tournament, and the PGA of America, the Drive, Chip and Putt Championship is a totally free across the country junior golf competitors for young boys and women ages 7-15 targeted at growing the video game. Individuals who advance through regional, sub-regional and local certifying make a location in the National Finals, which is performed the Sunday prior to The Masters at Augusta National Golf Club.

Own, Chip and Putt certifying is provided in all 50 states and involvement in case has actually increased each year.

" We have an excellent collaboration with our pals at the PGA of America and the Masters Tournament," Major stated. "Our leaders recognized that by pooling our resources at the nationwide level while triggering at the regional level, we might rapidly scale the program and get more kids included."

" Going into our 6th year, it is incredible to see how far the program has actually grown and the entry point we've developed together to keep our youth engaged. We eagerly anticipate continuing to develop the program to invite more youth to the sport."

The USGA, in collaboration with the LPGA, the Masters Tournament, the PGA of America, and the PGA TOUR, established The First Tee in 1997 particularly to answer the call for variety and addition. The program has actually invited countless brand-new gamers to the video game in the past 20 years by focusing not just on mentor golf abilities, however, life and social abilities such as rules, sincerity, regard, self-confidence, and obligation.

Founded in 1989, the LPGA-USGA Girls Golf program is targeted at ladies ages 6-17 and has actually played a vital function in not just inviting women and ladies to the video game, however possibly similarly notably keeping them in the video game.

" Statistics continuously reveal us that the social elements of the video game drive ladies and ladies to play golf," Major stated. LPGA-USGA Girls Golf, rather merely, has actually made it enjoyable and cool for women to play-- and play together. And the outcomes are impressive. We have actually traced more than 100 ladies who began in an LPGA-USGA Girls Golf program that played in a USGA champion in 2015. They have not just presented the video game to women and girls, they kept them in the video game, which is really amazing and motivating."

One business is taking on the development of the video game from another angle-- the devices side.

Because it's really starting back in 1997, U.S. Kids Golf has actually been concentrated on its objective, "To assist kids to have a good time finding out the long-lasting video game of golf and to motivate household interaction that constructs enduring memories."

To that end, the business started establishing youth clubs beginning out with simply 3 sizes and one item line.

The National Golf Foundation's annual report for 2016 exposed that involvement in junior golf programs stayed stable at 2.9 million most likely due in part to the success of the programs pointed out above and others much like them. Significantly, the variety of female junior golf enthusiasts has actually increased to a 3rd of all individuals and the variety of non-Caucasion gamers has actually risen to a quarter, 4 times exactly what it was a number of years earlier.

While time will eventually evaluate whether these programs and offerings serve not just to keep existing gamers, however, continue to bring in brand-new ones, the state of junior golf in the nation appears strong and on the right track in the meantime.
