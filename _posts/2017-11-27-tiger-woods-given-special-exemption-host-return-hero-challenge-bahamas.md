Tiger can't play anywhere he wants but is exempt into many events. While every other person in the 18-player field will be positioned among the main 50 on the planet, Woods - positioned 1,199th - will enter his first tournament to begin since pulling back from the Dubai Desert Classic before the second round on Feb. 3. From that point forward, he experienced his fourth back surgery.

Slowed down on 79 PGA Tour titles since 2013, Woods, 41, has made only 19 overall starts since the first of his back surgeries on March 31, 2014. Amid that traverse, he has missed seven cuts and pulled back from three tournaments. He missed the cut in the previous three majors he has played and has only a solitary best 10.

So with all that time away, how is Woods qualified to play when he continues official tournaments?

Generally, this isn't an issue. As a past champion, Woods is qualified to play the Masters and PGA Championship forever. He can play The Open until age 60.

The greatest issue will come at the U.S. Open, where Woods is excluded through just the 2018 tournament at Shinnecock Hills, in light of the 10-year exception he got for winning at Torrey Pines in 2008. Notwithstanding qualifying in some other way (world rankings, FedEx Cup), Woods would, in principle, need to experience sectional qualifying.

In any case, that without a doubt won't occur. Woods is probably going to get an extraordinary exception from the United States Golf Association in 2019 at Pebble Beach (where he won in 2000) and possibly the same number of as he needs past that.

Why? To begin, Woods is a nine-time USGA champion (three U.S. junior novices, three U.S. Novices and three U.S. Opens). Likewise, his place in the diversion recommends the USGA will compensate him, similarly as it jacked Nicklaus (eight unique exclusions) and Arnold Palmer (six). USGA official executive Mike Davis would not go so far as to promise it, but rather the easy win is that if Woods is playing and contending at a sensible level, he will get the exceptions in the event that he needs them.

Although Woods has not finished among the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings or money earnings since 2013 -- the basic barometer for exempt status -- he should have few worries about playing a full schedule, if he chooses.

For 2018, Woods is exempt based on his 2013 Players Championship victory, which comes with a five-year exemption. Once that expires, his Lifetime Member exemption would kick in, which gives exempt status to a player who has at least 20 PGA Tour victories. Davis Love III and Vijay Singh are using that exemption in 2018.

There are numerous exemption categories on the PGA Tour, and the Lifetime Member status is 18th on the list -- before the top 125 from the prior year's FedEx points list. In other words, Woods would have no trouble getting into any regular PGA Tour event he wants to play.

Where getting starts will be an issue is at the World Golf Championship events and the invitationals, including his own National tournament that has been played in Washington, D.C. The WGCs do not have sponsor exemptions nor any stipulations for past performance, not even for someone who has won 18 of them, such as Woods. He will need to perform now -- basically, get inside the top 50 in the world or the top 64 in the case of the Match Play event.

As for the invitationals? No sweat. The Arnold Palmer, Memorial (Jack Nicklaus) and his own National will undoubtedly give him a sponsor exemption and drop him at the first tee.

For a few, this appears the best road - which advantageously overlooks the way that many individuals resign to play golf and that golfers never truly resign.

If this somehow happened to occur sooner or later, there is no formal procedure for doing it with the PGA Tour, and it appears to be profoundly improbable that Woods would close the entryway on playing later on in any case and make a type of formal declaration.

Keep in mind that, he has business interests that make staying dynamic vital.

In 2017, Woods marked support manages Bridgestone golf balls and TaylorMade clubs. He likewise has his Tiger Woods Foundation, which depends on its namesake bigly for mindfulness and raising money. There is no better path for that to occur than for Woods to participate in his own particular establishment's tournaments (counting the Hero World Challenge, Genesis Open and the National) and by remaining unmistakable as a player. In years past, Woods gave his tournament rewards from occasions he facilitated specifically to his establishment.
