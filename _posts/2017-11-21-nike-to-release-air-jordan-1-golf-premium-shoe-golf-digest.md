When Nike revealed the Air Jordan 1 Golf shoe previously in 2017, sneaker-heads went wild. That minimal release, needless to say, rapidly sold out and was provided just in Jordan's renowned white-and-red color pattern. That will change quickly, just in time for the holiday.

The Air Jordan 1 Golf Premium, an all-black variation of the Air Jordan 1 Golf shoe, will hit digital shops (Nike.com and other online merchants) on December 15th. The shoe is made with a leather upper that, Nike states, will change into a patina as it's used. The shoe also includes a 1 year water resistant guarantee.

If there's a sneaker-obsessed golf player in your life, keep your eyes peeled for these kicks on December 15. It has the chance to be the best Christmas present ever.
