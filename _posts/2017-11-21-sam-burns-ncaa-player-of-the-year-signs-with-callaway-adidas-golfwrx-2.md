Sam Burns is officially a Callaway guy. The 21-year-old previous LSU standout begins the relationship at the Sanderson Farms Championship, and he'll be doing so with a complete bag of Callaway sticks.

Here are the clubs currently in his bag at the Sanderson Farms Championship.

As a sophomore, Burns won 4 times throughout the 2016-2017 season. He was named the NCAA Division I Jack Nicklaus National Player of the Year and was voted SEC Player of the Year. He was also a First Team All-American.

" I am so ecstatic to sign up with Callaway as I begin my expert profession," Burns stated. "I have actually been using their clubs and have seen how excellent the efficiency is, particularly in the irons. I'm going into the next stage of my golf profession with a great deal of self-confidence."

To accompany Callaway clubs, Burns will use Adidas clothing and shoes, per a news release today.

Burns has actually played a remarkable competition on the PGA Trip: He finished 6th at the Barbasol Champion in July, setting a scoring record for an amateur in a Trip occasion at the same time.

Callaway's present stable of young stars consists of Patrick Reed, Daniel Berger, Adam Hadwin, Wesley Bryan, Ollie Schniederjans, Aaron Wise, Branden Grace, Thomas Pieters, Michelle Wie, Grayson Murray, Patrick Rodgers, Emiliano Grillo, and, most just recently, Radical McNealy.
