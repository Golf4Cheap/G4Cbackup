A bad day on the golf course beats a good day at work-- unless you're clocking in at one of these 17 gigs, which we think any lover of the game would undoubtedly enjoy considering their everyday job.

CHEF AT CYPRESS POINT CLUB

The kitchen area personnel at Cypress Point have the tendency to stay, and not entirely for the enjoyment of peeling shallots. Work here, and you'll get the opportunity to play at one of the most exclusive clubs on the planet- for free!

BLIMP PILOT

The views from your perch 2,000 feet above America's many lovely courses are unequaled. And you won't have to hear anyone screamingÂ  "Mashed Potatoes!". It's a win-win.

STARTER AT THE OLD COURSE

Overlook the curmudgeonly disposition. Below that crusty Scottish outside is a bright soul whose heart warms at the sight of pleased golf enthusiasts lastly satisfying their dreams. Greet golfers living out their dream...not a bad job desription, right?

GREETER AT BANDON DUNES RESORT

In fact, the title is Director of Outside Happiness, and the pleasant man who holds it is Bob Gaspar, though locals call him "Shoe," owing to his similarity to the jockey Willie Shoemaker. Exactly what does Shoe do? He spends time the bag drop and the starter shack, shooting the breeze with resort visitors and passionate golf players, who, at Bandon Dunes, are one and the same.

GOLF AMBASSADOR AT SKIBO CASTLE

As soon as the country home of Andrew Carnegie, this stone-walled Shangri-La in the Scottish Highlands is now a hush-hush vacation for fortunate globe-trotters. At night, when visitors collect for fancy suppers, your task is to strike up discussion. By day, you might be hired to complete a foursome on the links course that twists around the castle premises. Some has to do it, might as well be you.

BARTENDER AT WHISPER ROCK GOLF CLUB.

The very first guideline about this club is that you do not discuss this club. We've heard enough whispers about Whisper Rock to understand that lots of Tour pros rank amongst the members. And where there are Tour pros there have got to be fat ideas (and great bar chatter), all the more so at a bar so chill and inviting it's called "The Hang." Can we get you a re-fill, Mr. Mickelson?
