While much of America remains in a post-Thanksgiving daze, or is rushing home from Thanksgiving with friends and family, the President will be investing this Black Friday on call with foreign leaders, and playing golf with a couple of the biggest names in the game.

President Trump revealed on Twitter early Friday morning that he would be talking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about local stability in the Middle East about a "mess" that he created.

Trump's Mar-a-Lago Thanksgiving

"I will get it all done, however exactly what an error, in lives and dollars (6 trillion), to be there in the first place!" the President tweeted.

Quickly after, the President tweeted that he would be visiting a different golf course of his in close-by Jupiter, Florida, to sneak a round in with none other than Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson, who, oh by the way, just so happens to currently be the No. 1-ranked golfer in the world.

"Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing a lot more tasks and business back to the USA!" Trump included in his tweet.

The Friday after Thanksgiving marks the 3rd day in a row that the President has actually invested at one of his golf clubs.
