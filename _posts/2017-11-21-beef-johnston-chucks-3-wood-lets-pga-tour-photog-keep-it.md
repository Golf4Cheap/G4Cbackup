'Beef' Johnston chucks 3-wood, lets PGA Tour professional photographer keep it

ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga.-- Englishman Andrew "Beef" Johnston felt as if his game remained in good condition heading into the RSM Classic, remaining confident as he entered.

Unfortunately, he had a hard time, shooting 75-77 and missing out on the cut by miles in his last PGA Tour start of the season. It ended a discouraging 2017, throughout which his finest showing was a tie for 10th in Puerto Rico.

It sufficed to make a man snap.

Johnston yanked a tee shot with a 3-wood into the native location on the left side of the par-4 4th hole on Seaside (his 13th of the day), and his club wasn't extremely far behind the golf ball. He madly helicoptered it into a marshy location, most likely never to be seen again. (He 'd go on to make triple bogey on the hole.)

Tournament leader Austin Cook, playing near, saw the entire scene unfold and had a good idea where Johnston's club toss came to rest; he tossed a ball in the basic direction, leading PGA Tour professional photographer Stan Badz to pitch in and bring it. Initially, when Badz saw the wild native lawn setting not far from the club, he believed it suggested a gator could be close by. He discovered the club, and when Badz went to return the Titleist 3-wood to Johnston, Johnston did a thoughtful thing: He informed Badz to keep it.

" Yeah, I lost 2 clubs today, a 3-wood and a 9-iron," Johnston stated. "I chucked the 3-wood in there (in the marsh) and clearly I should not have... however I was simply ... it broke me today. It truly did. It was among those things, it simply broke me.

" He (Badz) entered there and got it, and I resembled, 'No, you go on and have that ...' ".

When Johnston teed off on the next hole, he then recognized he still had the headcover to the 3-wood. He strolled over and provided that to Badz, too.

" It was the least I might do," Johnston shrugged.

After a rough number of days, he still smiled, which's why the man is so liked.

What's up next for him? Well, he, fellow Englishman Tyrrell Hatton (who is competing in Dubai), and a few of their pals and loved ones are off to Playa del Carmen, Mexico, to unwind and regroup.

Exactly what's on Beef's holiday docket?

" Chill out. I'm anticipating that," Johnston stated. "Maybe do a bit of fishing, see the ruins, simply hang out.".

Could this celebration in Mexico equal the notoriously wild Spring Break 2K16/Spring Break 2K17 Bahamas exploits of Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Smylie Kaufman?

Be alerted. As he movinged towards his vehicle, Beef flashed a devilish smile.

"There will be no comparrison," he stated. "You'll see."
